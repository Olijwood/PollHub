# PollHub

This is a svelte-based website that displays polls and allows you to create them. If you click on one of the answers on the poll it will add a vote to that answer. This project uses tweening so that the change in votes is smooth. This project also uses transitions to make changing tabs or deleting polls less jumpy.

# How to run the website

Make sure you have Node Package Manager installed, open a terminal in the directory with this project in and enter the command 'npm run dev' it will run in a localhost browser such as 'localhost:5000'.

# Disclaimer

Currently this project only saves the data during the active session, if you refresh the page it will return to the default poll. I will be implementing a database in a future update.
